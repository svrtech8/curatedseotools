Mule is an event-based architecture, Actions within a Mule network are triggered by either event occurring in Mule or external systems. Mulesoft 

events always contain some sort of data, the payload. The payload is used or manipulated by components and a set of properties that are associated 

with the processing of the event. These properties are arbitrary can be set at any time from when the event was created. The data in the event can 

be accessed in its original state or in its transformed state. The event will use the transformer associated with the Endpoint that received the 

event to transform its payload into a format that the receiving component understands.
